#### `ECtools`

This package contains tools for cleaning (primarily) bureaucratic data like court records. These functions are designed to solve problems commonly encountered in the UVA Equity Center's data-cleaning/data-wrangling work, like extracting valid ZIP Codes from addresses, assigning quarters to month/day combinations, correcting spacing errors near punctuation ("SMITH ,JANE" &#8594; "SMITH, JANE"), and so on.
